        San Francisco:the best and the worst
    </h1>
    <h2>
        The Best Neighborhood is Hayes Valley
    </h2>
    <p>
        I love Hayes Valley because it has <em>The Davies Symphony Hall ,Opera House ,The Ballet </em>and my favotite restaurant Jardiniere.

   <h2>
      My least favorite neighborhood is China Town.
    </h2>
    <p>
        I dislike <strong>The China Town Neighborhood</strong> because there is a lot of traffic and its always crowded.
