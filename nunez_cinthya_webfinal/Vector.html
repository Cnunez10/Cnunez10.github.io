  <p>My vector project was a creature that is part turtle and part unicorn. My inspiration for this project was the beach and animals.I enjoy going to the beach since I can remember.I decided to have the beach as my background for this project.I also love having animals around me and for this project we had to make a creature.I decided to combine a turtle and a unicorn together and i created my creature. I gave the creature pastel colors and circles,rectangles and triangles shapesThe challenges for me with project  was grouping elements together. </p>
