    <p> The motion project was very difficult for me because i was not understanding the tweens and the tools. My inspiration for this project was crazy,silly,clumsy cat Valentino. My motion project was a short story of my cat swaking through a forest and finding an egg in the middle of the forest. Valentino jumps on top of the egg and a friendly bird hatches out  of the egg.This project was very fun to create it was a challenge but  Iâ€™ve learn how to make a character vector and give the motion. </p>
